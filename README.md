How to Use:

1) Check if Chrome configured the extension correctly. Go to chrome://extensions/configureCommands.
Select any shortcut for "Turn on Special Keyboard". This is how you will "enable" the keyboard in a webpage.

2) Use the shortcut (i.e., Alt+Shift+X)

3) Below are the shortcuts, and their respective text results. If the webpage doesn't insert any text (i.e., GMail, Inbox, Google Docs), 
click the extension button (or the "Active the extension" shortcut: Ctrl(Cmd)+Shift+F), and type there. You can Copy+Paste as you normally would, or you can use the "Copy" button.
